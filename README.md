Inflation is an important economic indicator with significant impact on individuals, businesses and governments. Accurate inflation forecasts are essential for informed decision- making, including monetary policy, investment strategy and monetary policy. In this paper, we proposed a Time series Model ARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) to forecasting the Inflation Rate. To begin with, first we check the data provided to the model is stationary or not if not, we convert it to stationary data by differencing. Then we identify ARIMA model and find out its parameters using ACF and PACF. Then after finding the fit ARIMA model, we perform the residual analysis and the predict the inflation rate. Through our efforts, we achieved a 94% accuracy rate. To check to performance and robustness of the model we used the dataset on the inflation on Spanish Economy from Kaggle. It contains inflation rate of Spain from 1997 to 2021.
